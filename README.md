# Sensor Network - Rumor Routing Simulation

## Description
This project, titled "Sensor Network - Rumor Routing Simulation," is designed to analyze and simulate the efficiency of the Rumor Routing algorithm in wireless sensor networks. Rumor Routing is a key data dissemination method used in wireless sensor networks, particularly effective in scenarios where transmitting data to all nodes might be resource-intensive. This simulation aims to provide insights into the algorithm's behavior in terms of time and energy efficiency under various network conditions.

## Project Structure
- `RumorRouting.py`: Contains the implementation of the Rumor Routing algorithm and network simulation.
- `network_graphs/`: Directory containing graph data used for the simulations.
- `simulation_results/`: Directory where simulation results and plots are stored.

## Installation
No specific installation is required apart from the standard Python environment. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The project uses libraries such as `networkx` and `matplotlib`, which can be installed using pip:
```sh
pip install networkx matplotlib
